# Hill Street Books

## Description

Hill Street Books is an interactive bookstore for self-published childrenâ€™s books authors. Hill Street Books is trying to bridge the gap between the user and the authors. Many bookstores only publish small information about the author and their book. Hill Street Books allows for interacting with content on the author page of the bookstore along with purchasing the specific book. Some of the content on the page is videos, coloring pages, contest, and different featured characters. Authors will be able to generate more profit by managing transactions themselves and marketing their own books. Children interacting with the page will keep wanting to come back and feel like the authors books are always coming back to life.
